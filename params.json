I design human rights research with an eye to human interest and especially enjoy carrying out in-depth interviews. In my work I am driven by the question how human rights defenders and international courts, such as the **European Court of Human Rights**, can help victims of grave atrocities to find remedies and prevent future violations.\r\n\r\nI have 7 years of experience in conducting local fieldwork, social research, and human rights research in Russia. During these years I have carried out many interviews with young politicians, victims, human rights lawyers, and activists working for NGOs in Russia, the UK, Finland, and The Netherlands. On the basis of the results of my work I have published on the Chechen cases pending before the European Court, on how human rights organizations litigate before the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of victims of torture and discrimination, and on the protection of human rights defenders. \r\n\r\n##Publications\r\n\r\n[Van der Vet, Freek. 2014.
